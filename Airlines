 For this project, I downloaded Airlines Dataset from Kaggle.
 I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#First I determined every aircraft window seats for Business class
SELECT seat_no, aircraft_code
FROM travel.seats
WHERE fare_conditions = "Business"
and seat_no LIKE '_A%'
Order BY aircraft_code

# Which booking date has the most booking
SELECT Max(total_amount), book_date
FROM travel.bookings;

# Every cancelled flight out of Moscow Domodedovo Airport (DME)
SELECT *
FROM travel.flights
WHERE departure_airport= "DME"
AND status = "Cancelled"
ORDER BY "aircraft_code"

#Every airport with 'Asia/Yakutsk' timezone
SELECT airport_name
FROM travel.airports_data
WHERE timezone = 'Asia/Yakutsk'
